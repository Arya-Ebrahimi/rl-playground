## RL Playground
Welcome to my Reinforcement Learning playground. I will put the codes and exercises I do while learning RL here.

##### Table of Contents

1. [DQN](DQN " DQN") : DQN implementation using pytorch. I used the pytorch documentation in RL section with some small changes and a different environment. using both ReLU and Fuzzy Tiling Activations(FTA)

2. Tabular
   - [Dynamic Programming](Tabular/dynamic_programming " Dynamic Programming") : Policy and Value iteration algorithms are implemented and tested on two Gym environments.
   - [Monte Carlo](Tabular/monte_carlo " Monte Carlo") : Monte Carlo prediction and control for Blackjack.
   - [10 Armed Bandits](Tabular/k-armed-bandits): 10-armed bandit, testing different exploration approaches.
   - [MDP, Bellman equations and DP](Tabular/gridworld-dp): Chapter3&4 RLBook2018, MDP and Bellman equations, Dynamic Programming on custom gridworld environment.
   - [MCTS, FA and Policy Gradients](Tabular/mcts-fa-pg): Chapter8&9&13 RLBook2018, MCTS, Function Approximation and Policy Gradients, homework of rl-course-spring2023 @ Ferdowsi University of Mashhad.
   - [DP on Frozenlake](Tabular/dp-frozenlake): Chapter4 RLBook2018, Dynamic Programming, policy and value iterations on FrozenLake environment, mini-project of rl-course-2023 @ Ferdowsi University of Mashhad.
   - [Sample based methods](Tabular/sample-based-methods-taxi): : Chapter5&6 RLBook2018, A comparison of Monte Carlo and Temporal Difference control methods (SARSA & Q-Learning).
