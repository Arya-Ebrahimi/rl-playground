## RL Playground
Welcome to my Reinforcement Learning playground. I will put the codes and exercises I do while learning RL here.

##### Table of Contents

1. [PPO](PPO): A simple PPO implementation using pytorch both for continuous and discrete action spaces.

2. [DDPG](DDPG): Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient implementation.

3. [DQN](DQN): DQN implementation using pytorch. I used the pytorch documentation in RL section with some small changes and a different environment. using both ReLU and Fuzzy Tiling Activations(FTA)

4. [Tabular](Tabular): Implementations of tabular algorithms from "Reinforcement Learning: an introduction" tested on different gridworlds or gym environments.
